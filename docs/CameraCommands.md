## Info about the cameras
Each camera has a unique ID, which is used to identify it in the system. It also gets its own unique websocket, starting at port 50001 for the first camera, 50002 for the second, and so on.

The function format for the camera commands is as follows:
```
{
    "functiopn": "command_name",
    "arg1": value1,
    "arg2": value2,
    ...,
    "argN": valueN
}
```

# Camera Commands

### **`info`**

**Description:** Returns a comprehensive set of information about the current camera's configuration.

**Returns:**
* **`cam_name`** (string): The path to the camera.
* **`identifier`** (string): A unique identifier for the camera, often including its serial number, manufacturer, and model. If multiple cameras share a serial number, the program will append the USB port ID.
* **`horizontal_focal_length`** (float): The camera's horizontal focal length, used for distance calculations.
* **`vertical_focal_length`** (float): The camera's vertical focal length, also used for distance calculations.
* **`height`** (float): The camera's height off the ground, used for distance calculations.
* **`horizontal_resolution_pixels`** (int): The number of pixels in the horizontal direction.
* **`vertical_resolution_pixels`** (int): The number of pixels in the vertical direction.
* **`downscale_factor`** (int): An integer (greater than 1) that determines the scale at which the image is processed. The output resolution will be the original resolution divided by this factor, which can improve performance.
* **`tilt_angle_radians`** (float): The camera's angle relative to the ground. 0 is straight down, and Ï€/2 is straight ahead.
* **`horizontal_field_of_view_radians`** (float): The horizontal viewing angle of the camera, measured in radians.
* **`vertical_field_of_view_radians`** (float): The vertical viewing angle of the camera, measured in radians.
* **`color_list`** (list): A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the red, green, blue, difference, and blur values for a specific color to be detected.
* **`active_color`** (int): The index of the color from the `color_list` that the object detection model is currently using.
* **`record`** (bool): Indicates whether the camera is currently recording.
